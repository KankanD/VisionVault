# VisionVault

Hey I'm Kankan Dastidar, an IT Undergrad. This is one of my personal projects, an image gallery named "VisionVault" which is sort of inspired from Pinterest. Unsplash and pinterest are quite amazing resources to download and use images in projects and other places. With this image gallery, at this moment I might be showcasing my own clicked pictures but someday this is going to be a similar kind of application as compared to Pinterest or Unsplash and who knows, maybe this can be a new alternative amongst Gen Alphas and the upcoming ones.

## Tech Stack and Pre-requisites

- HTML & CSS
- Font "Bodoni Moda" from https://fonts.google.com/
- Images (Self-clicked)
